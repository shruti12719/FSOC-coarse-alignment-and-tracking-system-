# App Final — FSOC Coarse Alignment Mission Control

This web application wraps the supplied `2d final` simulator modules (`sim`, `vision`, `control`, `disturbance`, and `logging_`) in a FastAPI/WebSocket service. The browser does not generate target motion or tracking state: its 2D optical view and 3D world consume the same Python telemetry message.

## How to Run the Application

## Deploy to Render

This repository includes `Dockerfile` and `render.yaml`, so Render builds the
React client and runs the FastAPI/WebSocket service together. From your Render
dashboard, select **New > Blueprint**, connect this GitHub repository, review
the `fsoc-coarse-alignment-tracker` service, then select **Deploy Blueprint**.
After the health check at `/api/health` passes, open the generated
`https://<service-name>.onrender.com` URL.

The free plan is suitable for demonstration use. Its local filesystem is
ephemeral: reports, saved scenarios and uploaded benchmark videos are reset
when the service restarts. Add a persistent disk or external storage before
using it for retained production data.


## Running the Application

### Option 1: Run the Standalone Executable (`.exe`)

1. Open PowerShell or Command Prompt.
2. Go to the output folder:
```powershell
   cd dist\FSOC_Tracker
```
3. Launch the executable:
```powershell
   .\FSOC_Tracker.exe
```

The app opens in your browser. Closing the console window stops the app. Reports and uploaded videos are saved in the `FSOC_data` folder next to the executable.

### Option 2: Rebuild and Package the Executable

1. Rebuild the UI frontend:
```powershell
   cd web
   npm install
   npm run build
   cd ..
```
2. Generate the standalone executable:
```powershell
   python -m PyInstaller fsoc_app.spec
```

The new build is created in `dist\FSOC_Tracker\`. Share the whole folder, not only the `.exe`.

### Option 3: Run from Source (Development)

From the project folder, with the virtual environment set up:

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m server
```

Then open http://127.0.0.1:8011 in your browser.

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8011`.

## Included behavior


- Actual `VirtualScene`, `VirtualPTZCamera`, `BeaconKalmanTracker`, `DisturbanceManager`, classical detector, optional YOLO detector, and PTZ control code from the supplied 2D project.
- One WebSocket state for the image-forming 2D camera and Three.js world.
- Hide beacon → pure world-frame Kalman prediction → reappear at the prediction position before optical reacquisition.
- Start, pause, reset, trajectory selection, 0–10 decoys, disturbance controls, live analytics, saved scenarios, CSV export and PDF report export.


## Packaging


The web app is served from one FastAPI port. The original PyInstaller specification was not rebuilt in this pass; package `python -m server` with PyInstaller for the final standalone `.exe` once the required Python environment is fixed.
